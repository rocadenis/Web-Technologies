    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Product Scope</h2>
    <p>The project aims to develop a platform called ReFi (Resource Finder), which is a web-based application offering
        support to developers in collecting, interrelating, and discovering resources relevant to creative coding. These
        resources include specialized websites, tutorials, multimedia presentations, source code, software projects, and
        more. ReFi targets developers engaged in creative programming across various domains, catering to different
        programming languages, desired outcomes, interaction methods, and other preferences.</p>
    <p>Users of ReFi will be able to specify their purpose or preferences, such as "creating landscapes using fractals"
        or "needing a polyphonic generator." Based on these inputs, the platform will recommend existing software
        solutions, including frameworks, libraries, and components, necessary for realizing the desired artifact.
        Additionally, ReFi will facilitate the practical use of these recommendations by providing at least three
        examples of their application.</p>
